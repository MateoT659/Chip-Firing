#Chip Firing Simulation

Chip firing is a game played on signed graphs where chips are distributed around the graph through firings.  This program simulates the game in an easy to understand way. It was made entirely in C++ using SDL2 and the windows.h API. 

This project was made during the [Texas State 2024 Mathematics REU](https://www.math.txst.edu/research-conferences/summerreu.html) for the combinatorics research project. [Click here](https://github.com/MateoT659/Chip-Firing-Computation) to see the github page for chip firing code used in that research project.

This project was made as a functional extension of my Graph Visualizer project. [Click here](https://matoe.itch.io/graphs) to see that project, and [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ho3Lx3hVEormmCGTMAn2A1M-DE0VEHOI99eaIAoL5Nc/edit) for detailed instructions on usage.
